# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* The purpose of our analysis is to help us determine if a user applying for a loan is high-risk or not.
* The financial information is based on an applicants requested loan size, the loan's interest rate, borrower's income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt.
* Based on the total sample of `healthy loan` '0' vs `high-risk loan` '1', our model will help us predict whether an applicant is a high-risk or not.  The total sample size for each will help us determine our model's accuracy.
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1 - Original Data:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

* Machine Learning Model 2 - Over Sampler:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
